AidaWeb Smalltalk Web Application Server for Cuis 4.2

Port of Aida Web (http://www.aidaweb.si) to Cuis Smalltalk 4.2

Taken from Aida6.6-final.3 from the repo http://www.smalltalkhub.com/#!/~Aida/Aida/versions/Aida6.6-final.3

Updated to work with Cuis 4.2 2595

You will need to download the following git repositories as well:

https://github.com/pbella/Cuis-Smalltalk-Cryptography

https://github.com/pbella/Cuis-Smalltalk-Pharo14CompatibilityLayer

https://github.com/pbella/Cuis-Smalltalk-CompatibilityWithOtherSmalltalks

https://github.com/pbella/Cuis-Smalltalk-Sport

https://github.com/pbella/Cuis-Smalltalk-Swazoo

If you then copy all of the packages (*.pck.st) from the above repos as well as the Aida package from this repository into your local Cuis package directory, you can install by executing:

````
Smalltalk
	Feature require: 'Network-Kernel'.
Smalltalk
	Feature require: 'Aida'.
AIDASite initialize
````

Notes:
- AIDA demo does not start by default, hence the need to call 'AIDASite initialize'
- It is suggested that you start with a minimal Cuis image as there are some namespace conflicts (mainly with HTTP*) that occur with other Cuis core packages

Thanks to Germ√°n Arduino for his work originally porting all of this!
